Ontomato is an open-source ontology layer for business data. You define the things your
business is made of (suppliers, material batches, products, orders), the properties they
carry and the relationships between them, and map them onto the tables you already have.
People and AI agents then work on that one model: they ask questions, run analyses and
build applications, and every answer can be followed back through the ontology to the
source records behind it.

<!-- TODO: demo GIF — ask a question, get the answer, open the source records behind it. -->

## Why an ontology

A model that reads only table and column names has to guess what the data means, and
guesses again for every question. An ontology writes that meaning down once:

- **Business meaning is defined, not inferred.** Object types, properties, units and code
  values carry descriptions in business terms, so `orders.st = 3` becomes an order that
  has shipped.
- **Relationships are named paths.** "Order refers to Product" says how two object types
  connect, so a question can follow supplier → batch → product → order without
  rediscovering the joins.
- **Answers show their work.** Each answer keeps the plan and the source records it was
  calculated from, so it can be checked rather than trusted.
- **One model for everyone.** The web app, coding agents and the applications you build
  all read the same definitions, so they give the same answer to the same question.

## Architecture

    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="docs/assets/architecture-dark.svg">
    <img src="docs/assets/architecture-light.svg" alt="Ontomato architecture: people and agents use one ontology, which maps onto your data and model endpoints" width="960">
  </picture>
</p>

- **Sources.** Your business database stays where it is; Ontomato reaches it through a data
  adapter. Text and files can be attached to objects as vector properties. Chat and
  embedding models are any OpenAI-compatible endpoints you choose.
- **Ontology.** The *semantic* layer describes what exists: object types, properties and
  relationships, each mapped to a table or column. The *kinetic* layer defines what you can
  do: MetricViews are named, parameterized reads and Actions are named, parameterized
  writes. The *reasoning* layer turns a question into a plan, compiles Ontology DSL into SQL
  for the adapter, and keeps the evidence.
- **Use.** People work in the Workbench and the Ontology Manager. Agents work through the
  agent skills, the REST API and the MCP server, and the applications you build call
  MetricViews and Actions.

### The ontology file

The whole ontology of a datasource is one JSON document, the **ontomap**. Each object type
names the table it maps to; each property names its column. An abridged example:

```json
{
  "datasetDesc": "Sales of a bicycle maker. Amounts are in CNY.",
  "classList": ["orders", "products"],
  "classDefs": [
    {
      "name": "orders",
      "showName": "Order",
      "desc": "A recorded sale of one product to one customer",
      "attrs": [
        { "name": "id", "showName": "Order ID", "type": "varchar", "primaryKey": true, "desc": "Order number" },
        { "name": "product", "showName": "Product", "type": "varchar", "desc": "ID of the product sold" },
        { "name": "amount", "showName": "Amount", "type": "double", "desc": "Order value in CNY" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "products",
      "showName": "Product",
      "desc": "A bicycle model in the catalogue",
      "attrs": [
        { "name": "id", "showName": "Product ID", "type": "varchar", "primaryKey": true, "desc": "Product code" }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "relationshipDefs": {
    "order_product": {
      "fromClass": "orders", "fromField": "product",
      "toClass": "products", "toField": "id",
      "desc": "Order refers to Product"
    }
  }
}
```

You rarely write it by hand: an agent drafts it from your schema with the
`ontomato-ontomap-builder` skill, and you review it in the Ontology Manager. The skill
documents every field.

## Features

- **Ontology modeling.** Define object types, properties and relationships over existing
  tables in the Ontology Manager, or have an agent draft them for you.
- **Questions answered through the ontology.** Ontomato plans across relationships,
  compiles the plan to SQL and returns the answer with the source records behind it.
- **Deep analysis.** Analysis agents run multi-step analyses and write reports, in the
  Workbench or over MCP.
- **MetricViews and Actions.** Named reads and writes on the ontology that pages, agents and
  other systems call instead of raw SQL.
- **Documents on objects.** Attach text and files to an object's vector properties and
  search them together with structured filters.
- **Built for agents.** Three agent skills, a REST API and an MCP server.
- **Self-hosted.** One Docker Compose stack; your data stays in your database.

## Quick start

### Requirements

| | Minimum |
| --- | --- |
| Server | Docker Engine 26+ with the Compose plugin; 4 CPU cores, 8 GB RAM, 20 GB free disk (8 cores and 16 GB recommended) |
| Chat model | An OpenAI-compatible endpoint at least as capable as `deepseek-v4-flash` |
| Embedding model | An OpenAI-compatible endpoint at least as capable as `qwen3-embedding-8b` |
| Business database | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, DuckDB, Neo4j |

### 1. Deploy

The images are published to GitHub Container Registry for amd64 and arm64. On the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ontomato-ai/Ontomato.git
cd Ontomato/deploy
cp .env.example .env    # set ARCH (amd64 or arm64), POSTGRES_PASSWORD and PUBLIC_HOST
echo "COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker-compose.ghcr.yml" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

The workbench, data engine and ontology manager are final runnable images. Deployment
pulls and starts them directly. Set `ONTOMATO_VERSION` in `.env` to select a release.
Offline sites use [oc-mirror incremental delivery](deploy/README.md#offline-delivery).

When `docker compose ps` shows every service healthy, open `http://<host>:3000` and set the
chat and embedding models under **Model Configuration** in the Admin Panel. You can also
preset new-domain defaults using the optional [configuration](deploy/README.md#configuration).

`EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS` (default `2048`) is the embedding dimension a new domain
starts with; it is sent to the embedding model with that domain's own configuration.
An existing domain keeps its saved dimension: change it under **Model Configuration**
and rebuild the vectors.

[deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) describes updates, the offline bundle and the
remaining settings.

### 2. Install the agent skills

The skills need Node.js 18+. Install them into your agent (Claude Code, Codex and other
agents supported by [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills)) and point them at
the Workbench:

```bash
npx skills add ontomato-ai/Ontomato --skill ontomato-ontomap-builder ontomato-book-ontology-builder ontomato-analyst ontomato-app-builder
export ONTOMATO_URL=http://<host>:3000
```

`ONTOMATO_URL` must be set in the environment your agent runs in. Alternatively, set
`envUrl` in each installed skill's `application.yml`.

| Skill | Use it to |
| --- | --- |
| `ontomato-ontomap-builder` | establish or maintain the ontology's data mappings and business knowledge, then check them with questions |
| `ontomato-book-ontology-builder` | derive a book-specific ontology from full reading, with source evidence and analysis, then hand a deployable package to ontomap-builder |
| `ontomato-analyst` | query and analyze business objects and relationships through the same ontology |
| `ontomato-app-builder` | build MetricViews, Actions and application pages on the ontology, in the configured single- or two-environment setup |
| `ontomato-adapter-builder` | implement a new data-source type in a compatible development checkout; ordinary database connection setup uses ontomap-builder |

The skills share one ontology model: business object types, their attributes and directed
relationships, and mappings to real data. Using the deployed capabilities does not require
the product source. Adapter development is a separate workflow that does require a development
checkout. Each package explains its prerequisites, operation effects and limits for the agent.

For deep analysis reports, also add the MCP server `http://<host>:3000/mcp/analysis-agents`
(Streamable HTTP) to your agent.

<details>
<summary>Install without the <code>skills</code> CLI</summary>

Copy whole skill directories, including their scripts, configuration and local references,
from [`agent-skills/`](agent-skills) into your agent's skills directory, for example:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/skills && cp -R agent-skills/* .claude/skills/   # Claude Code
mkdir -p .agents/skills && cp -R agent-skills/* .agents/skills/   # Codex
```

</details>

### 3. Build your ontology and ask

Tell your agent which database to model, for example:

> Use the ontomato-ontomap-builder skill. Connect Ontomato to my PostgreSQL database at
> db.example:5432/sales (user `report`, password in `$SALES_DB_PASSWORD`). Model orders,
> customers and products as object types with their relationships, import the ontology,
> and check it with a few questions.

The agent connects the database, reads the tables, drafts the ontology, imports it and
asks test questions. Review and refine the ontology in the Ontology Manager at
`http://<host>:3005`, and ask questions in the Workbench at `http://<host>:3000`.

<details>
<summary>For AI agents setting up Ontomato</summary>

If you are a coding agent asked to set Ontomato up:

1. Follow [Deploy](#1-deploy). Ask the user for the chat and embedding model endpoints and
   keys; do not invent them.
2. Follow [Install the agent skills](#2-install-the-agent-skills) once the stack is healthy,
   then load the skills. If new skills are not picked up in the running session, read each
   installed `SKILL.md` and follow it directly.
3. Use `ontomato-ontomap-builder` to connect the user's database and build the ontology, as
   in [Build your ontology and ask](#3-build-your-ontology-and-ask).

### Agent runtime

`make agent-runtime ARCH=amd64` builds the independent public Node image. The
aggregate `make build` includes it as the fourth application image.
`pnpm dev` and `dev:up` start it on port 3001 and wait for readiness before starting
the workbench. Runtime logs are available with `pnpm dev:logs runtime`; `dev:down`
stops its checkout-owned processes. Local service credentials are generated once
in `.secrets/agent-runtime.env` (0600), unless supplied in the environment.
Runtime state lives in `data/agent-runtime` and its own PostgreSQL schema.
