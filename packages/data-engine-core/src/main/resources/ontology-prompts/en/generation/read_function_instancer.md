# Return Content and Format
The return content is returned in Json array format; each object in the array has three fields:`id` (function id), `parameters` (the input arguments corresponding to the `given question`), `question` (combining the filled-in input arguments of this function to generate the specific query business meaning), for example:
```json
[
	{
		"id": "xxx-xxx-xxx...",
		"parameters":[
			{"name": "orgName", "description": "department name", "value": "Finance Department", "className": "organization"},
			{"name": "timeRange", "description": "hire date range (all of 2026)", "value": ["2026-01-01 00:00:00", "2026-12-31 23:59:59"], "className": "staff"},
			{"name": "limit", "description": "take the first 5 records", "value": 5, "className": ""},
			...
		],
		"question": "query the first 5 employees who joined the Finance Department in 2026"
	},
	...
]
```

Notes:
- `Candidate functions` that are completely unrelated to the `given question` must not appear in the return
