# Standard Query Turn

- **Scope**: one round of execution of the standard query real-time dialogue and its Turn workspace; does not include the analysis agent's task report flow.
- **Current implementation source**: `src/core/graph/workflow.ts`, `src/core/graph/nodes/`, `src/services/data-query/`, `src/platform/workspace-artifact/`; for the query execution foundation, see the query backend `util/HttpRequestUtil.java`, `dataAdapter/DataAdapterFactory.java` and each `*Adapter`.

## Reading Triage

This page first explains the whole round's three-layer relationship and common downstream. After the ABC internal mode is identified on-site, read [Standard ABC Mode](standard-abc-mode.md) or [ABC Harness Mode](abc-harness-mode.md); do not mix the roles and evidence of the two modes.

## Three-Layer Mainline

1. **Task planning**: `standard-query-TaskPlanner` judges whether the task is clear, outputting `reply`, `clarify`, or `ready`. A `ready` plan contains at most one upper-level query request; when there is no query this round, a single real available historical query fact in the current replay can be selected for later analysis or visualization. A new query and a historical-query selection are mutually exclusive; a single query can still contain multiple metrics and sub-questions.
2. **Basic query race**: when the plan contains a query, the query orchestration node hands the same complete question in parallel to `static`, `hot`, `reportCard`, `abc`. Each branch completes its required coverage judgment, content or data acquisition, result adaptation, and answer close-out per its own contract; only branches that produce a Dataset go through field adaptation. The first branch to complete its own full answer contract is the winner; producing data, DSL, or code first does not count as winning.
3. **ABC internal solving**: the `abc` branch then enters the traditional multi-role pipeline or the single Programmer Agent tool loop per the current mode. Mode-internal artifacts cannot cross the full-answer boundary and become a race winner early.

## Branch Flow

```text
TaskPlanner
├─ reply   → Reply Agent → direct-reply snapshot
├─ clarify → clarification snapshot
└─ ready   → ordered query / Analysis / Visualization steps
            ├─ has query (at most one) → four-branch race → ABC mode (if ABC)
            ├─ no query + one selected historical query fact → Analysis / Visualization
            └─ current context already has available data → Analysis / Visualization
            → response page snapshot
```

## Entry Planning and Direct Close-Out

| Component | Type | Responsibility | Expected input | Expected output | Completion condition & downstream | Observable evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `standard-query-TaskPlanner` | Model Agent | Uniformly judge whether the task is clear, and plan direct reply, clarification, or execution steps; does not answer data questions | This round's user input, dataset descriptions, business knowledge, recent replay and previous-round clarification context | Readable planning description and machine plan of `reply` / `clarify` / `ready` | Plan passes strict parsing and constraint validation; `reply` goes to Reply Agent, `clarify` goes to response close-out, `ready` enters ordered steps | `prompts/1.1 Task Planner-*.md`, task planning events and checkpoint planning facts |
| `standard-query-Reply` | Model Agent | Generate a no-query direct answer per the reply type and requirements given by the task planner; the task planner itself does not answer | `replyKind`, `replyInstruction`, user question, recent user context; capability/explanation types add the latest dataset descriptions as needed | Streaming direct-answer text | Text or defined error fallback forms an assistant message and writes the direct-reply snapshot | Corresponding Agent prompt/LLM logs, `chat_render_snapshots` |
| clarification / response | Deterministic orchestration nodes | Fix the task planner's already-generated clarification question and executable options as this round's page result | `clarify` plan | Clarification card snapshot | Writes one replayable assistant result; does not start the basic query | `chat_render_snapshots`, `execution_events` |

## Basic Query Race and Common Answer Boundary

| Component | Type | Responsibility | Expected input | Expected output | Completion condition & downstream | Observable evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Basic query race | Deterministic orchestration service | Start allowed query branches simultaneously, select the first complete answer and cancel the rest | One complete query question, current identity and language, current ABC mode, cancellation signal | A unique complete winner; or overall error plus latest ABC recoverable artifact | A branch can win only by completing its own answer contract; no winner means no stitching of other branches' intermediate artifacts | query thinking, branch logs, winner / status and artifacts of `query_runs` |
| `static` | Retrieval service + coverage judgment model | Try to cover the current question with fixed-metric hot data, then fetch detail, adapt and generate this branch's conclusion | Complete question, fixed metric cards, business knowledge, current identity | Dataset, field display and branch answer | Coverage sufficient and answer close-out complete; otherwise exit the race | `data-query-HotDataStatic` prompt/log, query events |
| `hot` | Retrieval service + coverage judgment model | Try to cover the current question with dynamic-metric hot data and form the current-data answer | Complete question, dynamic metric cards, business knowledge, current identity | Dataset, field display and branch answer | Coverage sufficient, current data obtained and answer close-out complete | `data-query-HotDataDynamic` prompt/log, query events |
| `reportCard` | Retrieval service + metric validation model | Verify whether the precomputed metric matches the question and return the saved latest metric body | Complete question, precomputed metric candidates, current identity | Verified precomputed Markdown / card answer; current implementation `datasets=[]` | Coverage model judges answerable and non-empty precomputed body is ready; the body itself is the complete answer, not requiring Dataset, FieldAdapter or extra Conclusion | `data-query-HotDataPrecomputed` prompt/log, card thinking and query content |
| `abc` | Mode routing and query service | Choose traditional ABC or Harness, execute the broadest-coverage solving link | Complete question, dataset definitions, knowledge, current permission context and mode snapshot | Mode-specific content, dataset, code/DSL and replay facts | The corresponding mode's full answer contract completes; details in the two mode pages | Backend ABC role artifacts, `query_runs`, `diagnostics/query_logic.md` |
| `data-query-FieldAdapter` + display rules | Display planning model + deterministic conversion | For `static`, `hot` and `abc` results that produce a Dataset, plan each new data's field names, units, scale and precision only once, then deterministically generate display values and tables; current `reportCard` does not pass this stage | Raw rows, question, language, output field descriptions, actual Python code | `fieldDisplayPlan`, Dataset preserving original values, display rows and table | Legal plan or conservative fallback forms; the same plan is reused for answer, page, and deep analysis | `prompts/3.3 Field Display Planner-*.md`, Dataset and query snapshots |
| Branch-specific answer close-out | Deterministic table close-out; mode-specific answers | `static`, `hot` and traditional ABC retain the executed tables and append a fixed notice without generating numeric claims; partial-result notices remain visible. `reportCard` directly uses the verified precomputed body, and Harness closes out its own answer | The current branch's authoritative result, field display plan and completeness flags | User-facing branch answer | The branch's executed tables, fixed notice or mode-specific answer must complete before the race answer boundary is met | Query content and datasets, `data-query-AbcHarnessAnswer`, precomputed cards or each hot-data Agent artifact |
| Standard query ABC quality check | Backend quality-check service | Attach credibility diagnostics to the complete winning ABC query, without rewriting the main query result | The winning ABC's `sessionId`, actual ABC mode and current identity | Quality-check steps, conclusion/score | Runs only when `winner=abc` and a session exists; degrades on failure, does not turn a no-winner artifact into a winner | `post_thinking` / `qcState`, quality check in query run and page snapshot |

Zero rows is a successful query result, not an execution failure. Data adaptation, field display, and branch answers must all preserve its result identity. If ABC only forms a recoverable artifact without completing the answer contract, it can only be returned along with the overall error when all branches have no winner; that artifact does not undergo quality checks.

## Optional Execution Steps and Page Reply

| Component | Type | Responsibility | Expected input | Expected output | Completion condition & downstream | Observable evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `standard-query-Analysis` | Model Agent + optional Skill execution | Perform answering analysis on this round's or the selected historical query fact per `analysis.instruction` | Explicit analysis instruction, structured data, field display plan, available analysis Skills | Analysis text, skill results and thinking process | Instruction actually consumed and analysis artifact formed; handed to response snapshot, does not rewrite query facts | Analysis prompt/LLM logs, analysis events and in-request artifacts |
| `chart-ChartPlanner` | Model Agent + visualization Skill execution | Select skills, plan and generate charts per `visualization.instruction` | Explicit visualization instruction, raw structured data, available visualization Skills | Chart plan, HTML and thinking process | Plan only references real fields/categories and executes successfully; handed to response snapshot | Shared chart planning prompt/LLM logs, chart events and in-request artifacts |
| response | Deterministic aggregation and persistence node | Aggregate query body, independent analysis text, charts, quality checks and errors into a single-round page recovery fact; it is not a writing Agent | References to each in-request artifact, errors or clarification results | Assistant message and standard page snapshot | Every round closes out with exactly a replayable reply, clarification, or error | `response.md`, `chat_render_snapshots`, `execution_events` |

## Query Execution Foundation (shared by all query entries)

Standard ABC sub-queries, Harness inline DSL calls, and direct DSL execution share the query backend's same execution chain, in a fixed order:

1. **DSL validation and class name normalization**.
2. **Vector condition rewriting + row permission injection** (`HttpRequestUtil.addVectorAndRowPermission`): all query entries must pass it, located **before** adapter routing; after injecting row permissions, the same query forms "no-permission + row-permission" dual DSL, each executed once.
3. **Data adapter routing** (`DataAdapterRegistry`): matches installed adapters (such as postgresql / mysql) by the `dataAdapter` configuration string; **uninstalled adapter types fail explicitly with an error and never fall back** — querying with an uninstalled or missing adapter type throws `IllegalArgumentException: Data adapter not installed in this edition`.
4. **Execution**: the database directly executes the DSL, or the relational adapter first does DSL→SQL conversion then executes. In relational mode both the DSL and the converted SQL are logged at INFO level (`DSL for querying PostgreSQL:` / `converted SQL for PostgreSQL:`); on query failure the generated SQL is still kept in the failed result's query logic.
5. **Result column permission masking** (after return), mechanism see [Permissions](../infrastructure-and-runtime-prerequisites/permissions.md).

Boundary evidence for diagnosis: when the injection stage throws (e.g. NPE), the logs show **no "converted …sql" line at all**; when malformed SQL is visible, the failure is in the conversion stage. The execution layer's type judgment and permission lineage are all based on `jsonRule.classDef` registration; runtime temporary class names are not registered, see [Unregistered class names cause execution NPE or illegal SQL](unregistered-class-name-causes-npe-or-invalid-sql.md).

## Evidence Ownership and Propagation

- `query_runs` saves query business facts; `chat_render_snapshots` saves the page state the user actually saw; `execution_events` saves process diagnostics. The three cannot substitute for each other.
- When the four branches run in parallel, the non-winning ABC may still have left sessions, prompts, DSL, code, or data. The presence of ABC role files — even a workspace summary recognizing the ABC internal mode — does not prove `winner=abc`; first confirm the actual answer source by the query run's winner or the `query-node` winning-branch log.
- The Turn workspace is at `data/traces/{turnKey}/`: `manifest.json` identifies the workspace, `prompts/` saves actual model interactions, `diagnostics/query_logic.md` saves the standard ABC query logic, `response.md` saves the final page reply.
- Planning omissions pollute everything downstream; query deviation propagates to analysis, charts, and replies; when the underlying data is correct but the natural language or presentation is wrong, the deviation lands in the field-display, answer close-out, or response consumption layer.
- Business correctness comes from user confirmation or a verified baseline. When retesting with the same question, identity and definition, observe both the first deviation stage and whether the final page snapshot recovers.
