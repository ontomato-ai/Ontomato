## Scope and dependencies

This repository contains only the public product source, configuration templates and
tools. Do not import the old private repository's Git history, internal material, real
configuration or enterprise implementation.

`apps` owns startup and assembly; `packages` owns the actual implementation. The
workbench server, the browser interface, the data engine and the Ontology Manager are
maintained per their own runtime boundaries. Public modules must not depend on private
enterprise modules. The wire contracts shared by Node and the browser belong to
contracts, and browser code must not import server implementations.

Ontology Manager components receive the API, the current authentication and preferences
from the host; business permissions are decided by the server. Data browsing and visual
modeling belong to the Manager, and the main workbench keeps no second implementation of
them.

## Language

Write all new commit messages, including subjects and bodies, in English. Use
`type: description` for subjects. This applies to every branch, including `develop`,
feature branches, fix branches and `main`, and overrides the outer workspace's
Chinese commit-message convention for this repository.

Write new or changed source-code comments in English.

## Changes and verification

Check the actual modules and the existing build entry points first, then run the
applicable checks; do not invent commands or acceptance results
that have not landed. Keep the existing business, permission and data semantics, and
confirm the design before any new business change.

Java tests that touch databases, models or external systems must not be run unfiltered as
a whole. Real configuration and runtime data must not be committed. Save only this task's
results and protect other tasks' changes.

## Collaboration and working directories

Use an ordinary outer directory for an isolated pair of checkouts; do not add a third
repository, lock file or build configuration there. Public development uses `develop`, and each repository
branches, commits and merges on its own; a branch of the same name is not bound
automatically. Normal work starts from each repository's own `develop` as
`feature/<topic>` or `fix/<topic>` and merges back into `develop` when done. `stable` is
the maintenance line of released versions: fixes for a released version start from
`stable`, merge back into `stable`, and `stable` is then merged into `develop`; a new
version is prepared by merging `develop` into `stable` and is released from `stable`. The main
directory checks out `develop` + `develop` by default, and `main` is kept. Builds do not
implicitly fetch, pull or switch branches. Do not introduce a workspace manager.

Use the `worktrees/<topic>/{ontomato,enterprise}` Git worktrees, parallel to the two
repositories, only when the complete combination needs isolation, and keep the
`../ontomato` relative reference unchanged; for independent work on this repository alone
one worktree is enough, and the untouched side checks out an explicit mainline commit. Do
not create a permanent upstream copy, a submodule or a source SHA lock.

Before handing the main directory over for integration, each repository saves its commits
and pauses editing, confirms there is nothing left to save and the relevant services are
stopped, and releases any branch held by a feature worktree; then the main directory
checks out the required combination. Do not let two places write the same branch, and do
not automatically discard, stash or reset other people's work. Once the complete
combination passes, merge each repository back into its own mainline and verify the
mainline combination.

Clarify interface or boundary changes before implementing them, and the main controller
makes the final judgement on the combined result; acceptance by the main controller is the
confirmed approach for this migration and does not mean every later task must be accepted
this way.

## Public history and branches

`ontomato-ai/Ontomato` on GitHub is this repository's canonical development and
CI repository. Both `main` and `develop` live there: `develop` is the daily
development line, `main` is the release line. A release merges the reviewed and
tested `develop` into `main`, preserving ancestry, and tags the resulting
`main` commit as `v<version>`. Normal work starts from `develop` as `feature/<topic>` or
`fix/<topic>`. Maintainers validate their changes locally, merge them into
`develop`, check the combined result and push `develop` directly. A pull request
is not required for the team's normal workflow. External contributions follow
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
